    <h2>Visualizations</h2>
    <p>This page contains a set of time series visualizations for the US State of {{ state_long_name }} from the
        Consumer Protection Finance Bureauâ€™s Home Disclosure Mortgage Act API and seperates 15-year mortgages and
        30-year mortgages. These
        visualizations are aggregated from individual mortgage loans and measure a few financial metrics over time:

                    originated within the state.</td>

                    Loan-to-Value is calculated as the loan amount divided by the value of the property, and a larger
                    ratio will indicate a smaller down payment.</td>
